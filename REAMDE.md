the modifier can be either "WORKPLACE_SPACE" or "WORKPLACE_CAPACITY"
for "WORKPLACE_SPACE" values are the number of person, who can be present, by default it is 250, changing will set the the number for the next day
for "WORKPLACE_CAPACITY" values can be between 0 and 100, it is a percentage of the 250 person max, changing it this way will result in an immediate chenge is numger of people allowed in the office.
